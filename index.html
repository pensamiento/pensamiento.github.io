<sub5  id="Algorithmic Art"><a href="#">Algorithmic Art</a></sub5>
<br><br><br><br><br>
The concept 'algorithmic', derives from the word algorithm that finds its etymological roots in Medieval Latin with the word algorismus, a mangled transliteration of Arabic al-Kwarizmi "native of Kwharazm", a mathematician who made contributions through sophisticated mathematics to the world. The algorismus referred to the procedures for carrying out mathematical operations, later the term algorithm metaphorically denotes any step-by-step logical procedures, however the algorithms are techniques of abstraction, geometric approximation and incremental growth, and they are not strictly confined to mathematics (Chabert, 1999).
<br><br>
There are many explorations prior to the use of the 'algorithmic art' concept in the 60's, which broaden its spectrum of interpretation. We have been studying the field of relation between expressive creation and techniques of abstraction, since the beginning of humanity. The <i>xicalcoliuhqui</i>, also referred to as 'step fret', a pattern of mosaics created through shapes eminently geometric that is a representative resource of the cosmological ideas of the original peoples of America (Orozpe, 2010), can be found around the continent, and specifically in Mitla, Oaxaca, where we find this type of creations carved in stone covering the walls of the Zapotec palaces, referring to these creations, Japanese artist Kiyoshi Mizutani comments 'design is endowed with great life and intense aesthetic emotion' (1970, 296).
<br><br>
The invention of algorithmic computational languages, also called programming languages, dates back to around 1940, although the first computer program is attributed to Ada Lovelace, a mathematician and writer who detailed a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers during 1842-1849. The programming languages have taken inspiration from previous explorations that helped their birth, for example the punched cards, initially used around 1725 by Basile Bouchon and Jean-Baptiste to create woven patterns, later thanks to explorations carried out by Charles Babbage, punched cards began to be used to enter information through binary code into computers.
<br><br>
Algorithmic computational languages are called artificial, because 'they are constructed by individuals, rather than emerging from a wider cultural process as with natural languages' (McLean, 2011). They are used in a wide range of ways accross the world and also through varied approaches and perspectives, one of these being artistic expression. I'm interested in the study of the deep relationship between computer languages and human and poetic expression.

<sub5  id="Code as Expression"><a href="#">Code as Expression</a></sub5>
<br><br><br><br><br>
When referring to the relationship of code with expression, we implicitly go into language and writing; Exploring this deep relationship of code as an expression is one of the techniques at the heart of my practice and is the path I choose to write algorithms from improvisation and from the recombination of formal logic and poetic expression.
<br><br>
The way I express myself through computational languages in my artistic practice is through experience and intuition, playing and studying language, from an attunement between the emergence of a process and improvisation through writing. This practice is in confluence with the concept of multiple coding, or double coding, where the material aspects of code, functional and expressive (Cox, 2012, 9) are explored simultaneously.
<br><br>
'The history of computation is embedded in the history of humankind. Computation did not arrive with the machine, it is something that humans do. We did not invent computers, we invented machines to help us compute' (McLean, 2011, 13). In view of this, code is a reflection of human activity, I also referred previously to the broad spectrum from which I study the concept of algorithmic art, as part of this research-creation I am studying the field of relation between expressive creation and techniques of abstraction, exploring various paths to create algorithmic art from an interstitial field of experience.

<sub5  id="Live Coding"><a href="#">Live Coding</a></sub5>
<br><br><br><br><br>
One of the deepest interests of my artistic practice is to unfold algorithmic processes through improvisation. The practice of live coding has a creative potential for the creation of processes in constant reconfiguration, live coding is born out of the negation of the idea of programming as a preparatory activity '(Rohrhuber 2018, 35).
<br><br>
Around 2010, tired of the little interest of private design software companies towards the community, I decided to explore and study different alternatives, I found open source software and unexpectedly I came across live coding, I started to write visuals through Fluxus, a live coding environment that extends the Racket language with graphical commands (Griffits, 2003). In addition to the resonances that aroused in my interest in language as an expressive potential and in the interrelations of the image with sound, the focus of the community; collaborative and inclusive to all, made me feel welcome and allowed me to explore audiovisual creation through language. However, something essential that live coding has gifted to my artistic practice is the embracement of algorithms as thoughts. 'Live coding is not about tools. Algorithms are thoughts'. (TOPLAP, ManifestoDraft).
<br><br>
Through my research-creation, I am interested in creating propositions, practices of attunement, where thought is in movement and is activated transversally through conversational programming and collaboration, an example is 'The power of the spill', co-created with Csenge Kolozsvari, a proposition that emerges at the intersection of digital and imaginary technologies. A movement-choreography informed by somatic practices reconfigures the space by projecting back the image of a camera altered by feedback processes created through live coding. 'The piece asks: how can we sense the currents of the relational field? How might it be possible to stretch our perceptual habits that lead to actions that often disregard certain forms of life? How can we foreground that which we are usually missing and re-produce a deeply felt connection with the connective tissue of the world?' (Koloszvari, 2020)

<sub5  id="Performance"><a href="#">Performance - <i>Arte no-objetual</i></a></sub5>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Performance is an art form that consolidates as a term in the early 70s and finds its foundations in the explorations made since the 30s by various artistic practices and movements among which it is important to mention 'happenings', which are informal and accidental improvisations where viewers do not know exactly what will happen (Herrera, 1987). The etymology of performance comes from 'acomplishment'. 'Perform, comes from' carry into effect, fulfill and discharge', but there's also a theatrical/musical sense introduced in 1600. This musical sense, especially as musical improvisation is the one that my artistic practice embraces. The various implications in the definition of performance and mainly because of its complexity to be translated into my native language, years ago led me to feel more attracted to the concept of <i>'arte/acción'</i>, which is a way of referring to performance in Spanish; Afterwards, I discovered what was thought of as an artistic movement in Latin America and that was defined under the concept of <i>'arte no-objetual'</i>, which had its peak in the early 80s. <i>Arte no-objetual</i> questioned the work of art as an object and linked art to the Latin American social and cultural context. This art involves the improvisation of actions, but it also brings a space for the game and the exploration of the concept towards its redefinition. According to the Peruvian critic Juan Acha, thinking about art from the non-objective allowed to create links between art and everyday life. (Sierra 2013). I consider this link important, however, it seems that the use of the word performance ended up gradually blurring the concept of 'arte no-objetual', in this regard Diana Taylor, mentions that the use of the word performance, represents for some people a new colonialism, and argues that despite of this, performance art has an extended community of speakers who find in the breadth of the term possibilities that will be absent in their translation for 'execution' or 'actuation' (2011, 8).
<br><br>
With regard to the computational techniques embraced through this research-creation, live coding is the practice closest to the concept of performance, it involves improvisation with algorithms and is a relatively new practice with origins around 2002, live coding is in constant redefinition, however there are varied interpretations that approach live coding as a performative practice, since improvisation processes in a gig or a live coding session are usually projected and made public by sharing the computer screen with the processes of writing in movement. This is of important relevance because as Alex McLean mentions, exposing processes is part of the solution to our societies problems. Our approaches, such as projecting our screens, or opening the source of our software, are a symbolic call for process to be exposed. (McLean, 2015). I agree with Alex McLean, however my approach of live coding, is much closer to the experience of a gig of improvised music, I am interested in not limiting myself to the idea of ​​necessarily making the unfolding of language necessarily observable, but being in the relations ​​embracing algorithms as thoughts embodying concepts that allow creative expression through relational events and propositions. On the other hand, live coding has an influence that overflows through different resonances throughout my research, for example in the proposition that I have titled <i>'Resolana'</i> where the vitality of the writing and improvisation processes in live coding is an inspiration that has led me to rethink how a conversation can reconfigure the space, where relations undergo overlapping rhythmic actualizations and intensities that transform a lived experience.

<br><br><br><br><br>

One of the concerns that have been born from within my artistic practice is that of foster symbiotic relations between philosophical concepts and computational processes. Following this path I have chosen to explore diverse resonances between content and expression as assemblage. In confluence with my approaches to programming that undoubtedly come from the practice of live coding; The idea of making programming an open conversation has led me to explore the web as an opportunity to craft relational worlds through generative processes, propositions where time never ties back in one particular form. (Massumi, 2008, 13).
<br><br>
In light of the above, it is important to foreground that various artistic explorations before the invention of the web in 1989, have helped to shape the ideas that gave rise to its origin; long before the technical infrastructure could support their projects artists had conceived imaginative uses of digital communications at the interstices of creative studio and technology laboratory (Drucker, 2005).
<br><br>
Most of my learning in writing programming languages has been developed through intuition and experimentation with open source software, improvising audiovisual processes on-the-fly, however early in my experience as an artist-designer, the World Wide Web attracted me and I have conceived it as a space for the expression and creation of other possible worlds. 
<br><br>
In 2016, I started studying web programming, creating on this space I explored the possibility to integrate some of the programs and languages that I had been exploring, specifically JavaScript, this certainly inspired me and helped me to explore more deeply the interest that has been growing throughout this research-creation project (e.g. Resolana, Niyolpaki/Niyolchoka and jardim florido), which is to explore forms of coding that can deviate from what we see currently on digital platforms, which is intensely individualized self-presenting and relentless self-promoting (Manning, 2018).

<sub5  id="Methodology"><a href="#">Methodology
</a></sub5>
<br><br><br><br><br>

There's an embodiment of philosophical concepts at the heart of my artistic practice, which entails the creation of propositions and events, where thought is in motion and is transversally activated by different computational techniques and collaboration allowing us to experience the emergence of the relational fields. Relational fields, as I understand them, are openings onto experience where experience is not yet. A relational approach grows from inside and is a call for co-emergence and interdependence (Goodman 2018, 44), where a multiplicity of non-linear flows overlap and move into play with no particular endpoint. This experience involves an awareness of research-creation as an interwoven concept, which does not seek to separate research from creation: it creates conditions for new ways of encountering study.<sub5><a href="#1">&ensp;&ensp;1&ensp;&ensp;</a></sub5> Research-creation is approached as an active hyphen that brings making to thinking and thinking to making (Manning 2016, 13). This orientation toward study implies an attunement with the qualities of the event, in addition to an interest in what exceeds or escapes, the collaboration is inherent and creates new modes of experience as well as a potential to reimagine and reinvent itself in unexpected ways. It is important to understand events as lived relations that create space and time. The artistic work that I have been doing before and during the Master of Design has gradually led me to this mode of study: growing from inside my practice there is a rigor for experimentation that is generative of knowledge. Process is intimately related to my artistic practice and that is why this research-creation is in tune with 'process philosophy', Whitehead's term for his own activist philosophy at no remove from life's immediacy (Massumi 2011). "Immediacy is the realization of the potentialities of the past, and is the storehouse of the potentialities of the future" (Whitehead 1968, 99-100). The relations evolving through these processes remain open to unexpected revelations and discoveries, that is to say that they have a engagement with the speculative and potential aspects of the event (Ikoniadou 2014, 2). The force of change that activates the event works in the mode of speculative pragmatism, bringing with it an aspect of discovery, as it pushes the work to its overflow and this feedback into the process, so that it allows us to touch on the ineffable quality of its more-than. This makes it speculative. Speculative pragmatism, speculative in the sense that the process remains open to the more-than, and pragmatic in the sense that it is completely invested in its “something doing.” (Manning 2016, 33). 
<br><br>
The programming code is a protocol that enables constraints, but also unfolds a movement that is updated on the fly. Here, the pragmatic is linked to actualization, to the coming into itself of experience. Pragmatic is a synonym for composition: "how "processual differentials eventfully play out as co-composing formative forces (Massumi 2011, 12). The interstice of art and philosophy that unfolds into various propositions and events through my project, embrace speculative pragmatism not as a method, but as a technique that redirects its tendencies and helps keep it in movement. How is possible awake a sensibility in the experience of an event created by writing and unfolding computational processes can make the aliveness inherent of each multiple moment felt? Studying these tendencies  articulating philosophical thinking and artistic practice as an interwoven swing creates different modes of experience, sharing this study is the experience of knowledge that this research-creation contributes.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<i><sub5  id="1"><a href="#">1.</a></sub5> Study is here taken from Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's The Undercommons: 'When I think about the way we use the term 'study,' I think we are committed to the idea that study is
what you do with other people. It’s talking and walking around with other people, working, dancing, suffering, some irreducible convergence of all three, held under the name of speculative practice. The notion of a rehearsal – being in a kind of workshop, playing in a band, in a jam session, or old men sitting on a porch, or people working together in a factory – there are these various modes of activity. The point of calling it 'study' is to mark that the incessant and irreversible intellectuality of these activities is already present. Tese activities aren’t ennobled by the fact that we now say, "oh, if you did these
things in a certain way, you could be said to be have been studying." To do these things is to be involved in a kind of common intellectual practice. What’s important is to recognize that that has been the case – because that recognition allows you to access a whole, varied, alternative history of thought. </i>
